# PlantDiff

📘 **Project name**：PlantDiff

🧠 **Paper title** ：PlantDiff: A Diffusion Model for High-Fidelity Plant Image Generation with Discrete Wavelet Transform and Context-Augmented Cross Attention)

📄 **Paper status**: under review

💡 **Project description**: PlantDiff is a diffusion-based generative framework for synthesizing high-fidelity plant images with structurally complete morphology. It leverages latent diffusion models to ensure realistic leaf and stem arrangements while preserving fine-grained texture details.

🧩 **Released contents**:

1. core modules
2. pretrained weights
3. training code
4. inference script
5. The training code an inference script is currently under preparation and will be released in the future.

⚙️ **Main dependencies / frameworks**

1. Pytorch
2. transformers
